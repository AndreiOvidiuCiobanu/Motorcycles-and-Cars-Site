# Motorcycles-and-Cars-Site
My first attempt to crate a web-site to incorporate most of the features I've learned at school. The project contains HTML, CSS, and JS 
technologies.

In this project I incorporated:
# HTML
header
,nav
,section
,article 
,aside
,div, span

# CSS
position(relative, absolute)
,z-index
,transform
,transition
,animation
,box-model

# JS
stopPropagation
,addEventListener with three parameters
,setInterval + clearInterval
,window- open + close
